# Elements of Programming Interviews

My set of completed exercises and autograder code for the Elements of Programming Interviews (EPI) book. I read the book and did the Python exercises as part of my preparation for software engineering interviews.

## Running the test suite

### Python

```sh
python3 <program_name>.py
```

### Java

Compile and run a specific program using the Makefile.

```sh
make <program name>
```

## References

The autograder, exercise templates and pretty much everything else here is from the [EPI Judge](https://github.com/adnanaziz/EPIJudge) repository created by Adnan Aziz, who is one of the authors of EPI.
